Before doing this, review the ** Linear Model Extensions** lecture set slides 
from https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/lessons/linear-model-extensions
and the  **11_Mixed_models_and_other_extensions.R**
script in the lecture files folder of the
[CUNY-BioStats github repository](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats). 
Make sure you are comfortable with null and alternative hypotheses and appropriate plots
for all examples.

Remember you should

* add code chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by
pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* to answer the questions!
* **knit** your file to produce a markdown version that you can see!
* save your work often 
  * **commit** it via git!
  * **push** updates to github

1. In a study considering how the presence of sea stars changed snail growth 
patterns, ~25 snails were grown in containers containing 0,1, or 2 seastars.  
Since non-consumptive effects are often threshold based, these treatments levels
should be considered as groups (not as a continuous variable!).  The data is 
available at

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/snail_modified_for_class.csv   

FL is the final length of measured snails, and the treatment (coded 1-3) correspond
to  [1=Control (no predators). 2=1 predator treatment,3=2 predator treatment). 

What method would you use to analyze this data and why? Carry out your test, 
stating your null hypothesis, test assumptions, p-value, and interpretation.  
Describe any necessary steps and provide graphics and values as needed.  If 
needed, can you determine which treatments differ from each other?

2. (From OZDasl) The data give the ambient temperature and the number of 
primary O-rings damaged for 23 of the 24 space shuttle launches before the 
launch of the space shuttle Challenger on January 20, 1986. (Challenger was the
25th shuttle. One engine was lost at sea and could not be examined.) Each space
shuttle contains 6 primary O-rings.

Note these are counts. We can analyze this data using a Poisson distribution 
or binomial. Make sure you understand why each one is possible, which one is 
better, and carry out the analysis.  Data is available @ 

http://www.statsci.org/data/general/challenger.txt

3. Returning to the whelk length-mass relationship from class, try fitting an 
exponential curve to the data.  As a hint, try

```{r eval=F}
nls(Mass ~ exp(b0 + b1 * Shell.Length), whelk, 
                   start = list(b0 =1, b1=0), na.action = na.omit)
```

Compare this model to those that assume a linear and power relationship.  Data is available @

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/whelk.csv 

4. Going back to the TEAM dataset, remember we found that elevation had no 
impact on carbon storage.  But that was a linear fit. Use a gam (generalized 
additive model) to see if elevation can be related to carbon storage in an 
additive model.  Note we can use the gamm (generalized additive mixed model) 
function in the mgcv package to denote mixed effects.  For example (from help 
file)
```{r eval=F}
b2 <- gamm(y~s(x0)+s(x1)+s(x2),family=poisson,
           data=dat,random=list(fac=~1))
```
